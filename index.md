  <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
  <p>
    In a world of unprecedented wealth and technological capability, millions still lack access to basic necessities. Housing insecurity, food scarcity, and inadequate healthcare remain persistent challenges—not because solutions don't exist, but because our systems aren't designed to prioritize human wellbeing.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Change is possible.</strong> Throughout history, collective action and informed citizenry have transformed societies. From the labor movement winning the eight-hour day to civil rights activists dismantling legal segregation, ordinary people organizing together have achieved extraordinary change.
  </p>
  <p>
    Infini-Change provides the knowledge and resources you need to be part of this ongoing movement. Whether you're just beginning to question the status quo or you're a seasoned organizer looking for new perspectives, there's something here for you.
