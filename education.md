  <h2>Starting Point: Understanding the System</h2>
  <p>Before diving into critique and alternatives, it's essential to understand the foundational concepts of the economic system we live under. These definitions are presented neutrally to establish a common vocabulary.</p>

  <div class="definition-grid">
    <div class="definition-card">
      <h4>Capitalism</h4>
      <p>An economic system characterized by private ownership of the means of production (factories, land, resources) and their operation for profit. Decisions about production, investment, and distribution are made by private owners in competitive markets.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="definition-card">
      <h4>Commodity</h4>
      <p>Any good or service produced for exchange in a market rather than for direct use by the producer. Under capitalism, nearly everything—including labor itself—becomes a commodity to be bought and sold.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="definition-card">
      <h4>Profit</h4>
      <p>The financial gain realized when the revenue from selling goods or services exceeds the costs of production. In capitalist theory, profit is the reward for risk and investment; in critical theory, it represents value extracted from labor.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="definition-card">
      <h4>Labor Cost</h4>
      <p>The total expense incurred by employers for worker compensation, including wages, benefits, and payroll taxes. This represents what workers receive in exchange for their labor power.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="definition-card">
      <h4>Extraction of Profit</h4>
      <p>The process by which value is generated and captured at each stage of production—from raw material extraction through manufacturing to final sale. Critical economists argue that profit at each stage comes from paying workers less than the value their labor creates.</p>
    </div>

  <h2>Study Notes</h2>
  <p>Condensed insights and key takeaways from our educational journey.</p>

  <div class="notes-container">
    <article class="note-card">
      <h4>On the Tendency of the Rate of Profit to Fall</h4>
      <p class="note-date">Core Concept from Marx's Capital Vol. III</p>
      <p>Marx observed that as capitalists invest more in machinery (constant capital) relative to labor (variable capital), the rate of profit tends to decline over time. This is because, in Marxist theory, only labor creates new value—machines merely transfer their existing value to commodities.</p>
      <p>This tendency creates pressure for capitalists to cut wages, extend working hours, find new markets, or engage in financial speculation—behaviors we observe repeatedly in capitalist crises. Understanding this helps explain why "growth" is treated as non-negotiable under capitalism: without it, the system's contradictions become unmanageable.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="note-card">
      <h4>Hegemony and Manufacturing Consent</h4>
      <p class="note-date">Key insight from Gramsci & Chomsky</p>
      <p>Antonio Gramsci's concept of "hegemony" explains how ruling classes maintain power not just through force, but by making their worldview seem like common sense. The dominant ideology becomes invisible—it's just "how things are."</p>
      <p>Noam Chomsky and Edward Herman's "Manufacturing Consent" applies this to media, showing how news coverage systematically favors elite interests through structural filters rather than direct conspiracy. Recognizing these patterns is the first step to thinking beyond them.</p>

  <h2>Opinion & Analysis</h2>
  <p>Thoughtful perspectives on current events and enduring questions.</p>

  <div class="opinion-container">
    <article class="opinion-card">
      <h4>Why "Vote Blue No Matter Who" Fails the Working Class</h4>
      <p class="opinion-meta">Political Strategy Analysis</p>
      <p>The argument for unconditional Democratic support rests on harm reduction—and there's truth to it. Republican policies demonstrably hurt marginalized communities more directly. But this framing obscures a crucial dynamic: when voters signal unconditional support, politicians have no electoral incentive to deliver progressive policy.</p>
      <p>The result is a ratchet effect where Republicans push right and Democrats "compromise" by moving right as well. Meanwhile, working-class demands—universal healthcare, housing as a right, living wages—remain perpetually "unrealistic." A more strategic approach treats voting as one tactic among many, demands concrete commitments, and builds independent political power that can't be taken for granted.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="opinion-card">
      <h4>The Housing Crisis Is a Policy Choice</h4>
      <p class="opinion-meta">Economic Analysis</p>
      <p>When we call the housing situation a "crisis," we imply it's an unfortunate accident or natural disaster. But housing scarcity in wealthy nations is a direct result of policy decisions: treating housing as an investment vehicle, allowing corporate landlords to buy up housing stock, restricting new construction to inflate property values, and gutting public housing programs.</p>
      <p>Vienna, Austria houses 60% of residents in social housing with an average wait time of two years and rent-to-income ratios under 25%. This isn't utopian dreaming—it's functioning policy. The "crisis" framing lets policymakers avoid accountability for choices that prioritize property values over human shelter.</p>

  <h2>Thought of the Day</h2>

  <div class="thought-card">
    <blockquote>
      "The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways. The point, however, is to change it."
    </blockquote>
    <p class="thought-author">— Karl Marx, Theses on Feuerbach (1845)</p>
    <p class="thought-reflection">This famous thesis reminds us that understanding systems of oppression is necessary but not sufficient. Knowledge must translate into action. Every book read, every concept understood, should inform how we organize, how we support each other, and how we build alternatives. Education without praxis is merely academic; action without education is directionless. The synthesis of both is revolutionary practice.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div id="anti-capitalism" class="content-section">
  <h2>Anti-Capitalism</h2>
  <p>Critical analysis of capitalism's contradictions, failures, and the case for systemic alternatives.</p>

  <div class="topic-overview">
    <p>Anti-capitalism encompasses diverse critiques—from Marxist analysis of exploitation to anarchist rejection of hierarchy to environmentalist warnings about growth-driven ecological collapse. What unites these perspectives is recognition that capitalism's core logic (endless accumulation, commodification of everything, prioritizing profit over people) creates systemic harms that can't be reformed away.</p>
  </div>

  <h4>Key Resources</h4>
  <div class="resource-list">
    <div class="resource-item">
      <strong>"Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?"</strong> by Mark Fisher
      <p>Fisher coins "capitalist realism"—the pervasive sense that capitalism is the only viable system, making it easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism. A short, accessible entry point to contemporary anti-capitalist thought.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="resource-item">
      <strong>"The Conquest of Bread"</strong> by Peter Kropotkin
      <p>Kropotkin's vision of anarchist communism, arguing that society can organize around mutual aid and free association rather than wages and hierarchy. Written in 1892 but remarkably relevant to contemporary discussions of post-work futures.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div id="socialism" class="content-section">
  <h2>Socialism</h2>
  <p>Understanding socialist principles, history, and contemporary movements for economic democracy.</p>

  <div class="topic-overview">
    <p>Socialism is not a single ideology but a family of movements united by the goal of social ownership and democratic control of the means of production. From democratic socialism working within electoral systems to revolutionary communism to libertarian socialism emphasizing decentralization, socialist traditions offer varied visions of a post-capitalist world.</p>
  </div>

  <h4>Key Resources</h4>
  <div class="resource-list">
    <div class="resource-item">
      <strong>"Why Socialism?"</strong> by Albert Einstein (1949 Essay)
      <p>Einstein's Monthly Review essay remains one of the clearest articulations of why brilliant minds embrace socialism. He diagnoses capitalism's "crippling of individuals" and argues for planned economy with educational systems oriented toward social goals.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="resource-item">
      <strong>"The ABCs of Socialism"</strong> edited by Bhaskar Sunkara (Jacobin)

  <h2>LGBT Education</h2>
  <p>Understanding queer history, theory, and the connections between LGBT liberation and broader social justice movements.</p>

  <div class="topic-overview">
    <p>LGBT liberation is inseparable from class struggle, racial justice, and anti-imperialism. From the Stonewall uprising led by trans women of color to contemporary fights against bathroom bills and healthcare restrictions, queer movements have always been at the intersection of multiple forms of oppression—and multiple forms of resistance.</p>
  </div>

  <h4>Key Resources</h4>

<div id="race-education" class="content-section">
  <h2>Race Education</h2>
  <p>Examining racism as a systemic structure, its historical development, and movements for racial justice.</p>

  <div class="topic-overview">
    <p>Race is not a biological fact but a social construction—created to justify exploitation and maintained to divide working people. Understanding how racism was invented (to justify slavery), how it evolved (through Jim Crow, redlining, mass incarceration), and how it persists (in wealth gaps, healthcare disparities, police violence) is essential for any serious movement for change.</p>
  </div>

  <h4>Key Resources</h4>
  <div class="resource-list">
    <div class="resource-item">
      <strong>"The New Jim Crow"</strong> by Michelle Alexander
      <p>Alexander's landmark book reveals how mass incarceration functions as a racial caste system, controlling and disenfranchising millions of Black Americans. Essential reading for understanding systemic racism today.</p>

      <div class="resource-type">Essential Text</div>
      <h4>"The Communist Manifesto"</h4>
      <p class="resource-author">by Karl Marx & Friedrich Engels (1848)</p>
      <p><strong>Why read it:</strong> Despite being over 175 years old, the Manifesto's analysis of class conflict, capitalism's revolutionary transformation of society, and the tendency toward monopolization remains strikingly relevant. It's short (under 50 pages), accessible, and provides vocabulary and framework that inform virtually all subsequent leftist thought. Even those who disagree with its conclusions benefit from understanding the arguments.</p>

      <p class="resource-author">by Friedrich Engels (1847)</p>
      <p><strong>Why read it:</strong> Written as a catechism (Q&A format), this text is even more accessible than the Manifesto. Engels answers 25 questions about communism clearly and directly: What is communism? What is the proletariat? How did the proletariat arise? An ideal starting point before tackling longer works.</p>
