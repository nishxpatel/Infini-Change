  <h2>My Mission</h2>
  <p class="about-intro">
    I'm Nish, and I believe that meaningful change starts with understanding. In a world facing unprecedented challenges—from housing insecurity to healthcare access—I'm committed to using my skills in data analysis and science to illuminate paths toward a more equitable future.
  </p>
  <p>
    Infini-Change was born from a simple yet powerful idea: that education and collective action can transform society. By making complex information accessible and actionable, we can empower individuals to become agents of positive change in their communities and beyond.

  <h2>How My Skills Contribute</h2>
  <p>
    Data has the power to tell stories that words alone cannot. As a data analyst and scientist, I work to uncover the narratives hidden within numbers—stories of inequality, of need, and most importantly, of possibility.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether it's analyzing housing data to understand displacement patterns, examining healthcare access disparities, or modeling the impact of policy changes, I believe that evidence-based insights are essential for driving effective change.
  </p>
  <p>
    Through Infini-Change, I aim to bridge the gap between complex data and everyday understanding, making the case for systemic change accessible to everyone.
